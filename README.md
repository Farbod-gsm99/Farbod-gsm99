# Hello world! I'm Farbod ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Transportation Engineer and AI Systems Developer passionate about crafting intelligent, data-centric solutions for modern mobility challenges. My work primarily focuses on integrating AI-driven methodologies into intelligent transportation and traffic systems to enhance efficiency and safety.

I'm particularly enthusiastic about the evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic workflows. As these technologies advance, I aim to develop more complex and adaptive systems that push the boundaries of what's possible in transportation engineering.



## ðŸš€ Current Endeavors

Learning: Expanding my skill set in data science to manage and interpret transportation data more effectively.

Developing: Automating data collection and processing pipelines to transition my static traffic flow prediction model into a dynamic, real-time system.
## ðŸŽ® A Bit More About Me
Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm also a veteran game developer. While this profile focuses on my work in transportation and AI, feel free to explore my other GitHub page for insights into my game development projects.
